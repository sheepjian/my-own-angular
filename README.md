# Build My Own AngularJS

This repository contains my work when reading the book [Build Your Own AngularJS](http://teropa.info/build-your-own-angular).

## What I have learnt

* Test Driven Devlopment (TDD)


## Read, code, and think!

## How to get started

* Run "npm install" to install the environment
* Run "npm test" to verify all tests are passed
